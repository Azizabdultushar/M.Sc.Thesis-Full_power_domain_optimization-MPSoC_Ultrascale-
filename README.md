# size: 60x77mm SOM 132x140mm Carrier card
# sys logic cells: 256K
# Block RAM blocks: 144
# UltraRAM blocks: 64
# DSP Slices 1.2K
# Tools: Vivado 2023.2 Vitis 2023.2 and Petalinux 2023.2; Vivado/SDK/PetaLinux 20xx.x installed (important do not mix versions!)

Create Vivado Project, configure PS, Export HDF (XSA for 19.2 and newer)
Ceate new PetaLinux project
Import HDF(XSA for 19.2 and newer) into project
petalinux-build
copy boot.bin and image.ub to SD Card (only 2 files no more)
This is generic how-to, everything is setup for your by the Vivado->PetaLinux flow. Note, the boot.bin generated by PetaLinux may not always work, in such case it is recommended to make the boot.bin with SDK-GUI or command line tools manually.
